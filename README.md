# Penguin AHK

Club Penguin auto-clicker that uses AutoHotKey. Presently the only script is `mine.ahk` which will automatically mine using the jackhammer in the mines. The script is dumb though, so set the X and Y coordinate bounds to be a region on your screen in the area you want to mine. Something not too big but large enough to not get rate-limited on the coins.

To be clear I don't play Club Penguin much... Just a little fun among friends ðŸ˜Ž
